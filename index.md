# Abstract:
I did an NPM install of React's input validator program. I am not as good here as I am at PHP. I will totally own it. I went to the repository of the TA who apparently put this together? I cooked with some code there, before realizing npm already had documentation regarding how to do this from the actual React people. I put together three employees, and then included Milton from Office Space in my html.
